                    <h3>Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1912</strong> - born in Maida Vale, London</li>
                        <li><strong>1922~1926</strong> - educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School</li>
                        <li><strong>1931~1934</strong> - studied as an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge</li>
                        <li><strong>1936</strong> - published the paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" </li>
                        <li><strong>1938~1939</strong> - working part-time with the GC&CS</li>
                        <li><strong>1946</strong> - was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King George VI for his wartime services</li>
                        <li><strong>1954</strong> -  Turing's housekeeper found him dead</li>
                    </ul>
                    <blockquote><p>
                        "A new inquiry is long overdue, even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death—including speculation that he was murdered by the security services (or others). I think murder by state agents is unlikely. There is no known evidence pointing to any such act. However, it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated."</p>
